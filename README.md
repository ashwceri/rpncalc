# rpn-calc
# Basic stack based reverse polish notation calculator that calculates the sum of 2 numbers from a string input

- This was initially made in 2021 for university, I just decided to upload it here so that I dont lose it
- It was written to be used with a calculator that I made myself with an STM microcontroller and a soldered mini LCD screen
